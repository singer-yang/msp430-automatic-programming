# msp430-automatic-programming
## code of my dual degree graduation project  
My goal is to achieve automatic programming of MSP430 network, writing relevant program into each launchpad simultaneously. The steps are following:  
1. create a unique ID to identify each msp430
2. write different programs into msp430s by their ID
3. use multithreading to write programs into msp430s simultaneously
4. ...
